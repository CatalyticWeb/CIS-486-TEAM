# ChillAppz
## The Solution to all your Freezer exploding needs!
An application to time out the need for quickly refrigerated (frozen) sodas.
Have you ever gotten home from the store with groceries and wished that your newly bought soda was already cold, prompting you to place a few in the freezer? ... And then forget that it was put there. The result is _explosive_ ðŸ¤¯!

ChillAppz is here to save your day!
Angular Data is automatically synchronized between the model and the view components which is called data binding.
